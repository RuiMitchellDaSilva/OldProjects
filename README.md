# OldProjects
This repository contains a variety of old projects, either games or software that I have developed within University or in my spare time.

Construct2 Game : A simple, 2D game developed using Construct2 (requires Construct2 to run).

Tank : A 2D Tank game involving multiple levels, mouse and keyboard controls, and simple AI. Made in Visual Studio 2013, this was my assignment for my 1st year Fundamentals of Games and Graphics module.

Gataringan :  A 3D shooter that uses linked-lists and scene graphs for many of it's objects. This was an assignment for my 1st year Fundamentals of Games and Graphics module within the 2nd Semester.
